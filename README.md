## Description
Cryptomania is a crypto tracker app where crypto traders can visit to learn more about the latest crypto news and crypto prices. Cryptomania is derived from the word "kleptomania", and the tagline of the website is a play on the word "steal".

The app allows the user to have an overview of 100 cryptocurrencies and to gain more in-depth information on each coin. The app also allows the user to curate a watchlist so that the user can access the coin of interest quickly, regardless of which page of the website they are currently on. The user can also get the prices of coin in various fiat currencies, as well as the value of a coin in terms of other coins.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Simon and Joanna for their advice and guidance throughout this project. Through this process, I was able to gain a better understanding of working with the various tools that I have learnt.

## Summary and References
This is my first project using React after learning React for the first time just 2 weeks prior to starting the building of the website. I also had a shorter timeline to create a working app as I decided to use a different API and create a totally new app from what I initially had started on. Nonetheless, React turned out to be the more straightforward part - CSS was the real beast waiting to be conquered. It really took a lot more effort than what I thought was required to make the website look like an everyday app.
